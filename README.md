# AI-Classifier-Tool
design and implement a solution that classifies unstructured job titles into predefined job roles and seniorities. This will be an internal tool aimed at improving our data organization and workflows.

What We Need:

--A standalone freelancer (no agencies, please) to lead the development of this tool.
--A solution that integrates seamlessly with HubSpot, classifying data into 26 job roles and 8 seniority levels.
--A no-code maintenance approach, ensuring the tool is easy to manage without ongoing developer involvement.
--A feedback mechanism to refine the model over time and improve accuracy.

Key Features:

--Data Integration: The tool should process and classify HubSpot data and push the results back into HubSpot.
--AI Architecture: The model should be robust, efficient, and capable of improving itself via feedback loops.
--Overcoming Challenges: We've previously explored options like custom GPT, Zapier, and Clarifai but encountered limitations. Weâ€™re looking for fresh ideas and solutions to tackle these challenges.

To design and implement a solution that classifies unstructured job titles into predefined job roles and seniorities, we'll need to integrate a robust machine learning model into your existing workflow, particularly with HubSpot. Given the requirements, here's a step-by-step approach for creating the tool:
Step 1: Data Integration and HubSpot API Access

Before diving into the AI model, we'll need to ensure we can pull data from HubSpot and push the results back. HubSpot provides a comprehensive API that allows for both reading and writing data.

    Setup HubSpot API:
        You can access the HubSpot API to get contact properties, deals, and more.
        First, generate an API key from your HubSpot account (or use OAuth for better security).
        Install the hubspot-api-client Python package to interact with HubSpot.

pip install hubspot-api-client

    Integration Code Example: Here's an example of how to pull job titles from HubSpot and push the classified results back:

from hubspot import HubSpot
from hubspot.crm.contacts import ApiException

# Initialize HubSpot client
api_key = 'your_hubspot_api_key'
client = HubSpot(api_key=api_key)

def get_contacts():
    try:
        # Get the first 100 contacts
        response = client.crm.contacts.get_all(limit=100)
        return response
    except ApiException as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
        return []

def update_contact_job_title(contact_id, job_role, seniority):
    try:
        # Update contact with classified job role and seniority
        properties = {
            "job_role": job_role,
            "seniority": seniority
        }
        client.crm.contacts.basic_api.update(contact_id, properties)
    except ApiException as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")

contacts = get_contacts()
for contact in contacts:
    contact_id = contact.id
    job_title = contact.properties.get('job_title', '')
    # classify the job title
    job_role, seniority = classify_job_title(job_title)
    update_contact_job_title(contact_id, job_role, seniority)

Step 2: Text Classification Model (AI Architecture)

For this task, we can leverage a pre-trained transformer-based model, like BERT or RoBERTa, for text classification. These models have proven to be effective in understanding job titles and classifying them into predefined categories.

    Prepare the Dataset:
        You need a labeled dataset of job titles where each job title has both a corresponding job role and seniority level. For example:

Job Title	Job Role	Seniority Level
Software Engineer	Developer	Mid-level
Senior Data Scientist	Data Science	Senior
Marketing Manager	Marketing	Manager

    Train the Model:
        Fine-tune a pre-trained transformer model using the Hugging Face library to classify job roles and seniority. We'll use two separate classification heads: one for job role classification and one for seniority.

Install the necessary libraries:

pip install transformers datasets torch

Here's the Python code to fine-tune the model:

import torch
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification, Trainer, TrainingArguments
from datasets import load_dataset

# Load a dataset (or your custom dataset)
dataset = load_dataset('path_to_your_dataset')

# Load pre-trained tokenizer and model
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased', num_labels=2)  # Adjust num_labels

# Tokenize the data
def tokenize_function(examples):
    return tokenizer(examples['job_title'], padding=True, truncation=True)

# Tokenize the dataset
tokenized_dataset = dataset.map(tokenize_function, batched=True)

# Split into train and test
train_dataset = tokenized_dataset['train']
test_dataset = tokenized_dataset['test']

# Define the Trainer
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir='./results',          # output directory
    num_train_epochs=3,              # number of training epochs
    per_device_train_batch_size=8,   # batch size for training
    per_device_eval_batch_size=16,   # batch size for evaluation
    warmup_steps=500,                # number of warmup steps for learning rate scheduler
    weight_decay=0.01,               # strength of weight decay
    logging_dir='./logs',            # directory for storing logs
)

trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,                         # the instantiated ðŸ¤— Transformers model to be trained
    args=training_args,                  # training arguments, defined above
    train_dataset=train_dataset,         # training dataset
    eval_dataset=test_dataset            # evaluation dataset
)

trainer.train()

This is a basic fine-tuning procedure. You will need to tweak it based on your exact data structure and categories (job roles and seniority).
Step 3: Classification Logic and Integration

After training, the model can be used to classify job titles into predefined categories for job roles and seniority. Here's how to use the trained model for inference:

from transformers import pipeline

# Load the trained model for inference
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('./results')
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
classification_pipeline = pipeline('text-classification', model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)

def classify_job_title(job_title):
    # Use the classification pipeline to classify the job title
    job_role_prediction = classification_pipeline(job_title)  # Get job role
    seniority_prediction = classification_pipeline(job_title)  # Get seniority

    job_role = job_role_prediction[0]['label']
    seniority = seniority_prediction[0]['label']

    return job_role, seniority

# Example usage
job_title = "Senior Data Scientist"
job_role, seniority = classify_job_title(job_title)
print(f"Job Role: {job_role}, Seniority: {seniority}")

Step 4: Feedback Mechanism

To ensure the model improves over time, we need a feedback loop that allows users to correct any misclassifications and retrain the model. This can be implemented by:

    Collecting Feedback:
        Allow users to flag misclassified job titles.
        Store these corrections in a feedback database (e.g., a HubSpot property or external database).

    Retraining the Model:
        Periodically retrain the model with the new, corrected data to improve its accuracy.
        You can automate this retraining by setting up a cron job or scheduling retraining at regular intervals.

Example feedback collection:

# Let's assume the user flags the misclassified job title
def collect_feedback(job_title, corrected_job_role, corrected_seniority):
    # Store the feedback in a database (or back in HubSpot)
    print(f"Storing feedback: {job_title} corrected to {corrected_job_role} and {corrected_seniority}")

Step 5: No-Code Maintenance Approach

For a no-code approach to maintenance, ensure:

    User Interface (UI):
        Build a simple dashboard that lets non-technical users interact with the system. For instance, use Google Sheets or a custom UI tool like Streamlit to allow users to upload new job titles and provide feedback.
    Monitoring:
        Set up monitoring of model performance using logs to track accuracy and user feedback, ensuring any issues are flagged for review.
    Retraining on Demand:
        Allow admins to manually trigger retraining of the model with new feedback data from the UI.

Conclusion

By leveraging machine learning models (like BERT), the HubSpot API, and a feedback mechanism, this solution can classify job titles into predefined job roles and seniorities. The tool integrates seamlessly with HubSpot, processes the data, and provides a simple interface for non-technical users to maintain and improve the system over time. This approach also ensures that the model can continuously improve through user feedback, without requiring ongoing developer involvement.
